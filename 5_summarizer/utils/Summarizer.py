    texto = """Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that mimics human intelligence. It involves developing algorithms and machines that can think, learn, and act like humans. In essence, AI simulates the way we think, making decisions, and solve problems. The goal of AI research is to create intelligent systems that can interact with humans in a meaningful way.
            Currently, AI is being developed in various fields such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. These technologies enable machines to recognize patterns, make predictions, and generate responses similar to human behavior. Some examples of AI applications include virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis systems, and recommendation engines.
            The development of AI has far-reaching implications for various industries, including healthcare, finance, education, and transportation. By creating intelligent machines, humans can automate routine tasks, reduce errors, and improve decision-making processes. However, the field of AI is also facing challenges such as ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in machine learning algorithms.
            Overall, artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving field that holds great promise for transforming industries and improving human lives. As research continues to advance, we can expect to see more sophisticated AI systems that can learn, adapt, and interact with humans in a way that simulates the complexity of human intelligence."""
